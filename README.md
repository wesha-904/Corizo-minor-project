# Capstone Project: Body Measurements Analysis using NumPy & Matplotlib

This project is the **Capstone Project** for my internship at **Corizo**.  
It focuses on analyzing real-world body measurement data using Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and basic statistics.

---

## Overview

We use data from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)**, specifically:

- `nhanes_adult_male_bmx_2020.csv`
- `nhanes_adult_female_bmx_2020.csv`

These datasets contain body measurements (like weight, height, waist, hip, arm length, etc.) for adult males and females.

Using NumPy and Matplotlib, we perform:

- Data loading and matrix handling
- Histogram and boxplot visualizations
- BMI calculation and standardization (z-scores)
- Correlation analysis
- Ratio analysis (waist-to-height, waist-to-hip)
- Interpretation of outliers and extremes

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scipy`
